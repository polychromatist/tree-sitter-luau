==================
Basic variable assignment
==================

x = 1

---

(chunk
  (assign_stmt
    (var
      (name))
    (number)))

==================
Multiple variable assignment
==================

a, b = 1, true

---

(chunk
  (assign_stmt
    (var
      (name))
    (var
      (name))
    (number)
    (boolean)))

==================
Complex variable assignment
==================

a, b, c.d.e[f][g][1], h:i().j[k]:l()[m] = true, false, 1, 4

---

(chunk
  (assign_stmt
    (var
      (name))
    (var
      (name))
    (var
      (name)
      (name)
      (name)
      (var
        (name))
      (var
        (name))
      (number))
    (var
      (call_stmt
        (var
          (call_stmt
            (var
              (name))
            (name)
            (arglist))
          (name)
          (var
            (name)))
        (name)
        (arglist))
      (var
        (name)))
    (boolean)
    (boolean)
    (number)
    (number)))

==================
Local variable declaration, no assignment
==================

local x

---

(chunk
  (local_var_stmt
    (binding
      (name))))

==================
Local variable declaration
==================

local x = 1

---

(chunk
  (local_var_stmt
    (binding
      (name))
    (number)))

==================
Multiple Local variable declaration, no assignment
==================

local x, y

---

(chunk
  (local_var_stmt
    (binding
      (name))
    (binding
      (name))))

==================
Multiple Local variable declaration
==================

local x, y = 1, false

---

(chunk
  (local_var_stmt
    (binding
      (name))
    (binding
      (name))
    (number)
    (boolean)))

==================
Luau: Compound assignment
==================

a += 1

---

(chunk
  (var_stmt
    (var
      (name))
    (number)))
